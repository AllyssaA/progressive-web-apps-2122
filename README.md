## Description
In this course we convert the client side web application, made during the Web App From Scratch course, into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Finally we’ll implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.

## Goals
After finishing this program you can:
- _deal with server side rendering;_
- _implement a Service Worker;_
- _enhance the critical render path for a better runtime or percieved performance._

- ~~*You understand the difference between client side and server side rendering and you can apply server side rendering in your application*~~
- ~~*You understand how a Service Worker works and you can implement it in your application.*~~
- ~~*You understand how the critical render path works and how you can optimize it for a better runtime and / or perceived performance.*~~

## Grading
Your efforts will be graded using a single point rubric (see below). You will have to pass the criterion (centre column) to pass the course. During the test you will be consulted and will be given feedback on things we think deficient and things we think are an improvement on the criterion.

| Deficiency | Criterion | Improvement |
|:--|:--|:--|
|  | *Project* Your app is working and published on Heroku. Your project is thoroughly documented in the `README.md` file in your repository. Included are an explanation of client- server rendering, an activity diagram including the Service Worker and a list of enhancements to optimize the critical render path implemented your app. |  |
|  |*Serverside rendering* You’ve implemented serverside rendering and have articulated how it works and why you should want it. |  |
|  |*Service Worker* You’ve implemented a usefull Service Worker and show it’s working in an activity diagram. |  |
|  |*Critical render path* You’ve enhanced the critical render path for a better runtime or percieved performance in multiple ways and have described how you managed to do this. |  |

We will have our final [peer review session](./course/peer-review.md). You will read, comment and fire issues on each others code. Doing this helps others dotting the i’s on their project.

<!-- Here are some hints for your project! -->

<!-- Start out with a title and a description -->

<!-- Add a nice image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend 📸 -->

<!-- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages 🌐-->

<!-- replace the code in the /docs folder with your own, so you can showcase your work with GitHub Pages 🌍 -->

<!-- Maybe a table of contents here? 📚 -->

<!-- ☝️ replace this description with a description of your own work -->

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? 🤓 -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->

<!-- ...you should implement an explanation of client- server rendering choices 🍽 -->

<!-- ...and an activity diagram including the Service Worker 📈 -->

<!-- This would be a good place for a list of enhancements to optimize the critical render path implemented your app  -->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

<!-- We all stand on the shoulders of giants, please link all the sources you used in to create this project. -->

<!-- How about a license here? When in doubt use GNU GPL v3. 📜  -->
